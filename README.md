# Diabetes Linear Regression Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a Simple Linear Regression analysis using the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn.

## Overview

This notebook focuses on building a Simple Linear Regression model to predict diabetes progression based on a single feature from the diabetes dataset. It covers data loading, visualization, model training, prediction, visualization of results, and model evaluation.

## Files

- `ML_Simple_Linear_Regression_prac.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and analysis.

## Libraries Used

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Notebook Contents

1. **Importing Libraries**: Imports necessary libraries for data analysis and model building.
2. **Loading and Preparing Data**: Loads the diabetes dataset and prepares the data for modeling.
3. **Data Splitting**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training and Prediction**: Trains a Simple Linear Regression model and makes predictions.
5. **Visualization**: Visualizes the test data and predicted values on a scatter plot.
6. **Model Coefficients**: Displays the slope (coefficient) and intercept of the regression line.
7. **Model Accuracy Evaluation**: Calculates the R-squared (R2) score to evaluate model accuracy.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Open `ML_Simple_Linear_Regression_prac.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell sequentially to observe the step-by-step analysis and results.
